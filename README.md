Just walked out of The King of Kings. Yep, that happened. First, whoa, did anyone else feel like they were being dragged by a runaway horse carriage through biblical history? I'm not saying it was bad, but I mean, phew. Epic, is this the word, or should I say... long? Maybe it's my aching back speaking, or the fact that my feet died an hour ago in those darn shoes.

Isn't it funny how every scene screams, This is important! Like, calm down, movie. We get it, you got a message. My brain's still trying to fit together all those dramatic head tilts and halo lighting. I kept thinking, could they have slapped any more shine on Jesus' hair? I swear, it looked better than mine has in years without a single hot roller. Envy in the temple, who would've thought?

> At one point, midway through the scene where the crowd's just losing it, I wondered if I'd left the stove on. That's where my apostle-level focus was, in the domestic sphere, while Rome burned or converted or whatever. Maybe that was symbolic. Who knows!

And did you see that eyeliner on the Romans? Galactic black lines sharp enough to cut through the plot's gravity. There's probably a credible metaphor for their moral ambiguity hidden in there somewhere, but honestly, eyeliner that fierce needs its own credits line.

But I can't pretend. I'm hooked. Those vast landscapes, the kind where you half-expect Moses to amble across and ask if you want chips with that. The movie captures you in, like a grand magical garment, woven or knitted, not sure what fits here, but you get it. There's so much rich tapestry, I almost felt like a part of it might unravel and reveal a secret.

```javascript
function walkOnWater() {
  if (disciples.remainFaithful()) {
    return true;
  } else {
    throw new Error('You doubt too much');
  }
}
```

By the end of it, with all the splendor and tear-jerking sounds — you know, the ones blaring like the choir's final hallelujah — I might actually download the movie. Or, heavens protect me, watch the movie again. After all, my oven's still the biggest sinner here, might have to sort that one before Jerusalem.

But really, that was something. Something alright.
